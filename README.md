# Sports League Database System

This project showcases the design and implementation of a relational database system for a high school soccer league. The solution improves data management for scores, standings, team stats, and emergency contact information—solving limitations of the previous Excel-based system.

## 🎯 Objective
To replace inefficient spreadsheets with a scalable, normalized database system that ensures accuracy, consistency, and ease of access across league operations.

## 🛠️ What We Built
- **ERD & Schema Design**: Carefully modeled team, player, match, and contact data using MySQL Workbench and Visio.
- **Data Normalization**: Implemented a normalized relational schema (3NF) to eliminate redundancy.
- **SQL Development**: Wrote complex queries for reporting standings, match histories, and player statistics.
- **Testing & Optimization**: Validated the database for accuracy, integrity, and performance.
- **Budget-Conscious Deployment**: Designed with a $10,000 budget constraint for a realistic implementation scenario.

## 💡 Impact
This system:
- Enhances data reliability and accessibility.
- Enables faster, more accurate game-day decisions.
- Improves communication between staff and parents via emergency contact tracking.
- Lays a foundation for league expansion and integration of mobile apps or web dashboards.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- MySQL
- MS Access
- MS Visio
- SQL
- Excel (initial data prototyping)

## 📄 Example Queries
Sample SQL queries (e.g., match history, rankings, player performance) are included in the [final project report](https://github.com/ekaterina-d0/sports-league-database/blob/main/Final%20Report.docx).
